# GitHubFollowers

A feature-rich iOS app for searching GitHub users and exploring their followers. This project was implemented entirely in UIKit and serves as a showcase of my skills and understanding of UIKit development, navigation, and best practices. While based on a tutorial, all implementation is my own, demonstrating what I have learned.
